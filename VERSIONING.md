# Versioning Strategy

ContentEngineAI follows [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) principles with a clear pre-production strategy.

## Version Format

**`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`**

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes that require user intervention
- **MINOR**: New features, backward-compatible functionality
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, performance improvements, documentation updates

## Pre-Production Phase (0.x.y)

**Current Status**: ContentEngineAI is in active development toward a stable 1.0.0 release.

### 0.x.y Strategy

- **0.1.0**: Initial open source release with core functionality
- **0.2.x**: Feature enhancements, additional platform support
- **0.3.x**: Performance optimizations, API refinements
- **0.4.x**: Advanced features, community-driven improvements
- **0.9.x**: Release candidates, stability focus
- **1.0.0**: First stable production release

### Breaking Changes in 0.x

⚠️ **Important**: During the 0.x phase, breaking changes may occur in minor versions.

We will:
- Document all breaking changes in the CHANGELOG
- Provide migration guides for significant changes
- Announce breaking changes in advance when possible
- Maintain backward compatibility when feasible

## Release Process

### Release Schedule

- **Patch releases**: As needed for bug fixes (weekly/bi-weekly)
- **Minor releases**: Monthly for new features
- **Major releases**: When significant breaking changes are necessary

### Release Workflow

1. **Development**: Feature branches merged to `main` via Pull Requests
2. **Testing**: Automated CI/CD pipeline validates all changes
3. **Release Preparation**: Version bumped, CHANGELOG updated
4. **Tagging**: Git tag created (`v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0`, etc.)
5. **GitHub Release**: Automated release notes generation
6. **Communication**: Community notification of new releases

## Path to 1.0.0

### Stability Criteria

ContentEngineAI will reach 1.0.0 when:

- ✅ **Core Pipeline**: End-to-end video production pipeline stable
- ✅ **Multi-Platform Support**: Amazon + 2 additional platforms
- ✅ **API Stability**: Public APIs finalized with backward compatibility
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete user and developer documentation
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: >95% code coverage with comprehensive integration tests
- ✅ **Performance**: Consistent sub-5-minute video generation
- ✅ **Community**: Active contributor base and issue resolution
- ✅ **Production Use**: Successfully deployed in production environments

### Post-1.0.0 Promise

After 1.0.0 release:
- **Semantic Versioning**: Strict SemVer compliance
- **Backward Compatibility**: Breaking changes only in major versions
- **LTS Support**: Long-term support for major versions
- **Migration Guides**: Comprehensive upgrade documentation

## Version Support

### Current Support Policy

- **Latest Version**: Full support with new features and bug fixes
